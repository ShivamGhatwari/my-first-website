					<h2>Thumbbad</h2>
					<p>
						My friend recommended it to me, I remmember I was watching it at 10 o'clock at night alone. Every scene
						was so horrifing at the same time so cool that I couldn't put it down. For few days after watching it I
						was avoiding darkness thinking "Haster aa jayega".
